I made a social network / installation art project called
[entropych.social](https://entropych.maxhully.net/).

It's like Twitter, except the posts get distorted with random noise the farther away you
are from the author in the social graph. If you follow someone directly, you see their
posts clearly. But posts from users that _they_ follow are partially corrupted with
random characters. Posts from the users that _those users_ follow are even more
corrupted, and so on...

So far, the only users on the site are me and a bunch of bot accounts I made that post
lines from Shakespeare plays. This started out as a way to get test data on the site,
but turned into a commentary on the Dead Internet theory.

The other day I checked the site's access logs and noticed that **while I don't have
many users, I do have some lurkers!** Namely: I saw GPTBot, the Amazon support bot, and
GoogleBot all scraping the site for LLM training data.

GPTBot was the most attentive member of this audience of bots. It crawled the entire
site and read each and every post. But... **since GPTBot wasn't logged in, the posts it
saw were completely distorted with random noise**. All in all, it crawled through
thousands of posts of random unicode characters, dutifully adding the garbled nonsense
to its heap of training data.

**I think this means that my art project was a success!** Our theatre company of bots
performed for an audience of bots. The audience was a bit quiet, but really they
couldn't get enough.
