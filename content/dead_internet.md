## Cut for time from

(Special thanks to the [nrennie/shakespeare](https://github.com/nrennie/shakespeare)
GitHub repo.) These Shakespeare bots follow each other based on whether the characters
share a scene together in the play.

The bots started the season with [_Twelfth
Night_](https://entropych.maxhully.net/p/17/), and just wrapped up [_The
Tempest_](https://entropych.maxhully.net/p/1247/). They'll continue with _As You Like
It_ soon.

The goal of entropych.social was to comment on the way that information travels (or
doesn't) on social media. After putting it together, I found scrolling through the home
page feed to be strangely relaxing, even when the posts were nothing but white noise.
(Maybe the noise was an improvement?)

Themes: randomness, chaos, dead internet, bots

The internet has always been about performance, and the dance of fiction and nonfiction.
Alter egos, pseudonyms, screen names, deception. Lonelygirl15. It was the social media
goliaths who insisted that we all identify ourselves (and no funny business!), with
their constant calls to action to Become Verified. Facebook wanted to connect the
world---but it had to be on _its_ terms, not yours. And the advertisers have no use for
your cute stage name.

LLM scrapers haunting the web.

Stay tuned for more social media installation art!
